# Telco_Churn_Feature_Engineering
Telecommunication Churn Feature Engineering
Business Problem

Machine learning model that can predict customers who will leave the company
development is desired. Required data analysis before developing the model
and you are expected to perform feature engineering steps.
Dataset Story
Telecommunications customer churn data shows a fictitious company providing home phone and Internet services to 7,043 customers in California in the third quarter
Contains information about a telecom company. Which customers left, stayed, or signed up?
shows.


Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
Step 1: Examine the overall picture.
